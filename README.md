# gfw-umd-loss-gain-lambda

### Background

This repo takes Matt McFarland's [raster lambda demo](https://github.com/mmcfarland/foss4g-lambda-demo) and uses it to provide a scalable alternative to the GEE-backed [umd-loss-gain](https://github.com/wri/gfw-umd-loss-gain-lambda).

This usage grew out of the need to process 2000 palm oil mills in under 5 minutes, per the requirements for the upcoming GFW Pro application.

### Endpoints

The endpoints deployed are designed to exactly mimic existing GFW API endpoints, making it easy to 'plug' this service into existing code. The current exposed endpoints are as follows:

Base URL:
https://0yvx7602sb.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/

/umd-loss-gain:
Replicates the existing umd-loss-gain endpoint

/analysis:
Runs analysis for loss | gain | extent against a polygon AOI. These requests are parallelized under the hood as part of the umd-loss-gain endpoint

/landcover:
Matches the /landcover endpoint on the GFW API, but only provides analysis for `primary-forest` data (the only layer required by GFW Pro batch analysis at this time)

/loss-by-landcover:
Matches the /loss-by-landcover endpoint, again only providing results for `primary-forest` data

### Limitations

Our main obstacle here is speed; particularly large areas may time out. This isn't an issue for the palm-risk use case (all areas are 50 km buffers of palm oil mills) but we could run into this if we expand the usage of this repo.

If we need to cross this bridge, the subdivide_polygon function in the [original repo](https://github.com/mmcfarland/foss4g-lambda-demo/blob/master/handler.py#L63) will likely help.

## Development

1. Install Serverless Framework
```
npm install
```

2. Install python dependencies in virtualenv
```
./scripts/setup.sh
```

3. Activate virtualenv
```
source env/bin/activate
```

4. Test locally
```
python handler.py
```

5. Configure `serverless.yml` to specify your AWS profile and s3 buckets

6. Create serverless stack and deploy
```
./scripts/publish.sh
```
